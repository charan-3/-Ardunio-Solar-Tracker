# Ardunio-Solar-Tracker
Initial stage of our project- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83528610/116805542-d5525280-ab44-11eb-9c3a-75bee6948ca4.png)


Finally ended up like this- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83528610/116805595-28c4a080-ab45-11eb-8d6f-1b39201608cc.png)

Solar tracker  is a device which will automatically orient in the direction of high intensity sunlight to effectively harness maximum solar power.we can develop an automatic solar tracker by using a solar panel, light-dependent resistor (LDR) and DC motors based on ardunio platform.
When the sun moves, the LDR sensor senses a reduction in light intensity forcing the DC motors to adjust solar panel accordingly in the direction of high intensity.
Solar panels are used to convert light energy into electrical energy

1.	The main objective of our project is to consume maximum solar energy  through solar  
           Panel.   
2.	The solar panel tracks the sun from east to west automatically for maximum intensity of              
            Light.

Procedure:

>>>Single axis tracer:

Single axis tracker have one degree of freedom that acts as axes of rotation.These are typically normal to one another

Single axis tracker allows optimum  solar energy levels due to their ability to follow the 
Sun vertically and horizontally

 >>>Ardunio Severino board: Ardunio  is a development platform for the purpose of programming AVR microcontrollers. 
     AT MEGA328 is a modified Harvard arch .8-bit RISC single chip microcontroller which was developed by Atmel in 1996.

>>> LDR Sensor-
We  are using   LDRâ€™s as a sensor to track the position of sun or density of sun light. Output      voltage is proportional to light incident on LDR which is further processed to move solar panel.

>>> Servo Motor-
Servo shaft is rotated by an angle depending on the ON-time and OFF-time of the pulse.Here we are using two servo motors one for Horizontal movement and another for vertical     movement.
When high intensity light falls on the solar tracker LDR sensor senses a reduction in light intensity forcing the DC motors to adjust solar panel accordingly in the direction of highintensity.



.Conclusion: 

The invention of solar tracking system helps us improve the performance of PV solar 
system in a simple way. 

Used  relative method of sun light strength.

Established a model of automatic tracking system to keep vertical contact between 
solar panels and sunlight.


Improved the utilization rate of solar energy and efficiency of photovoltaic power generation system.
